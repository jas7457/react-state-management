# React State Management

This project is a playground to test out the functionality and APIs of various React state management libraries. The findings here will be used to determine what state management library we want to use at Proofpoint/PSAT.

## Considerations

-   Community adoption
-   Upkeep
-   Ease of use / exposed API
-   Low render thrashing

## Tested Libraries

-   Zustand
-   Jotai
-   Valtio
-   Mobx

## Available Scripts

### `yarn server start`

This runs the GraphQL server in packages/server to try out some asynchronous state management

### `yarn client start`

Launches the React application in the browser.
